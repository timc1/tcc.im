Personal site with Three.js/WebGL! 🍦 (https://tcc.im/)

* Work with only a simple html/css file, and a bit of vanilla javascript to move things along
* Create structured, no-excess markup, a11y to improve accessibility, and animations that *only* alter transforms and opacity
* Build an animated world globe and allow visitors to drop their name, location, and a message on top of it for others to see
