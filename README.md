Vanilla personal site üç¶ https://tcc.im/

Step out of React world for a second -
* Work with a simple html/css file, and a bit of vanilla javascript to move things along
* Create structured, no-excess markup, a11y to improve accessibility skills, and animations that *only* alter transforms and opacity
* Build an animated world globe and allow visitors to drop their name, location, and a message on top of it for others to see
